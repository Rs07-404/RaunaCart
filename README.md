## Google OAuth Troubleshooting

If Google OAuth is not working even after providing the default client ID, you may need to create your own OAuth 2.0 Client ID in Google Cloud Console.

### How to Create Your Own Google OAuth Client ID

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:**  
   [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis)

2. **Select your project** (or create a new one if needed).

3. **Enable the "Google Identity Services" API**  
   - In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for "Google Identity Services" and enable it.

4. **Configure OAuth consent screen**  
   - In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
   - Choose "External" and fill in the required information (app name, support email, etc.).
   - Add your email as a test user if the app is in testing.

5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID**  
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
   - Choose **Web application**.
   - Set a name (e.g., "RaunaCart Web Client").
   - Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add:
     - `http://localhost` (and/or your development port, e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
     - Your production domain if deployed
   - Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, you can leave this blank for Google One Tap or add as needed.

6. **Copy the generated Client ID**  
   - After creation, copy the **Client ID**.

7. **Update your `.env` file**  
   - Set `VITE_FIREBASE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file to the new client ID you just created.

   ```
   VITE_FIREBASE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_new_client_id
   ```

8. **Restart your development server**  
   - Stop and restart your dev server to apply the new environment variable.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Firebase errors:** Double-check your `.env` values and that your Firebase project is set up correctly.
- **Google OAuth errors:** Ensure your domain is in the Firebase **Authorized domains** and the correct Web Client ID is used.
- **Dependency issues:** Always use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
